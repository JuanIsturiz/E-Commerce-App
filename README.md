Hello again!! Welcome to the second phase of the [E-Commerce-App-REST-API](https://github.com/JuanIsturiz/E-Commerce-App-REST-API), this time it's a fullstack PERN app project, an E-Commerce with client and backend implemented.

Thank you for joining me in my coding journey!!

### Description

An application where I combined my knowledge with postgres, express, react and node to replicate the same functionability of a real E Commerce website.

### Setup

1. Run `npm install` in the root, frontend and backend directories so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
2. Pass the correct information to the .env, config, dbConfing and databaseSetup files to connect the program with a database.
3. In the backend folder run `node databaseSetup` to create the necessary tables for the API to work with.
4. In the root `npm run dev` to start both server and client for the app work properly.
